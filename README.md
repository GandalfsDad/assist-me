# AssistMe
This is just a simple CLI tool written in python for basic interaction with LLM's.
Currently only supports GPT-3/4 OpenAI API's.

---
## Setup
Installation is possible directly from github using pip.
```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/GandalfsDad/assist-me.git'
```
An OpenAI API key is required and should be in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

---
## Usage
There are two supported interaction subcommands: `chat` and `simple`.
Simple is a one response version of chat where you can ask a question and get a single response.
Chat is a more interactive version where you can ask multiple questions and get multiple responses.


### Simple
```bash
assistme simple --input "What is the meaning of life?"
>>> Response: The meaning of life is to live a life of meaning.
```

If the `input` flag is not provided the user will be prompted for one.

```bash
assistme simple
>>>Input: 
```

### Chat
```bash
assistme chat
>>>Input: 
```
The chat interface will await a user input  and then respond and await another input until you kill the process or type `exit`,`q`, or `quit`.


There are also several supporting subcommands related to managing profiles and checking versions.

### Profile Commands

`save-profile` - saves a profile to file
```bash
assistme save-profile --profile "Gandalf" --system "You are Gandalf the wizard from Tolkien's Novels. You respond only as he would"
```

`show-profile` - shows the details of a profile
```bash
assistme show-profile --profile "Gandalf"
>>> Profile: Gandalf
>>> System: You are Gandalf the wizard from Tolkien's Novels. You respond only as he would
```

`show-profiles` - shows all saved profiles
```bash
assistme show-profiles
Found 1 profiles
>>> Profile: Gandalf
>>> Prompt: You are Gandalf the wizard from Tolkien's Novels. You respond only as he would
```

### Version
```bash
assistme version
>>> AssistMe version: 0.0.4
```

### Options

#### --name / -n [name]
The `name` option can be used to specify the name of the Assistant. This is mostly only relevant for chat but possible to use with simple as well.

```bash
assistme simple --name "Gandalf"
```

#### --model / -m [model]
The `model` option can be used to specify the model to use. Currently only `gpt3` and `gpt4` are possible with 3 being the default.
Values are not case sensitive.

```

#### --system / -s [system]
The `system` option can be used to specify the system message.

```bash
assistme simple --system "You are Gandalf the wizard from Tolkien's Novels. You respond only as he would"
```

#### --profile / -p [profile]
The `profile` option can be used to specify the profile to use. If not provided the default profile will be used.
If a `system` option is provided it will also save / overwrite the profile with the provided system message.
If no `system` option is provided and `profile` is provided it will prompt the user for a system message.

```bash
assistme simple --profile "Fred" --input "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?"

Default is 750.

```bash

```

#### --temperature [temperature]
Sets the temperature for the API call. This is the randomness of the response. The higher the number the more random the
response. Default is 0.5.

This is an option for the `simple` command only. If it is omitted you will be prompted for input.
